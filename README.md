# CSS-Practice 

This is a simple app I made just to practice all the different types of styling. 
There's so many different types of styling and a lot of them do very similar, but importantly different things. I wanted to make a project where I could review them all, and use it as a helpful reminder for myself of the difference between things like justify-content options. 


# Background and Approach 
when I started, I didn't really have a fleshed out plan. I was thinking about some class notes from my time at Per Scholas where we created boxes and practiced changing the styling on them. I started thinking about this while working on a simple calculator project and thinking about the button styling. 

I decided I would start with a title on top of the page and a handful of text lines that I could add styling to and change around. 

To help me review, I looked at the MDN docs for styling, and then FlexBox Froggy, which felt like a faster and more condensed way to review. 

This led me to decide to create different styling sections on the page so I can see them all one after another in action, and read a definition and then see it in action. 
Then I decided maybe I would use buttons and onClick I could have the styling change
